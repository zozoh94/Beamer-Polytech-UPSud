After that, you should be able to \r\nuse the TU/e Beamer theme in your Beamer presentation using the following lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\usetheme[department=winuk,official=false,theme=cyan,innovation=false]{tue2008}\r\n\\mode<presentation>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are many more options and of course, you can play with the values. The \r\nabove values are by no means recommended or default, just an example. Also refer \r\nto [Options for the theme](#theme-options). It is probably best to put these \r\nlines right after your `\\usepackage` declarations, which in turn should come \r\nafter the\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\documentclass[12pt, aspectratio=169]{beamer} % aspectratio = 43 or 169\r\n```\r\n\r\nline at the top of your TeX source file.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the theme only works correctly when using PDFLaTeX. With XeLaTeX, \r\nthere are strange problems: for example the slide number becomes black instead \r\nof the correct theme colour.\r\n\r\nTheme options\r\n-------------\r\nThe theme supports the following options, which can be passed to it in the usual \r\nway: in the `\\usetheme` line (refer to [Usage \r\ninstructions](#usage-instructions)). All options are key/value pairs. Most \r\noptions were present in the original TU/e theme, but they are documented here \r\ntoo for completeness.\r\n\r\n| Option key               | Default value  | Possible values                                                                                                | Option description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\r\n| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| theme                    | red            | Refer to the [theme colours](#theme-colours) section.                                                          | Used to change the colour theme of all slides.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\r\n| department               | none           | none, ele, eleuk, win, winuk, bmt, bmtuk, bwk, bwkuk, id, iduk, chem, chemu, tm, tmuk, phys, physu, wtb, wtbuk | Used to change the deparment at the bottom of all slides.

In all other cases, the text colour will be white.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is possible to select a custom theme colour. The text is always \r\nwhite at the moment, so be aware of that. Also, it is not recommended to use a \r\ncustom colour, because the TU/e has a well-defined and well-balanced colour \r\npalette. Now that you are warned: you can pass the value `\\#bada55`, or any \r\nother HTML colour code, to use that as a theme colour. Again, the text will be \r\nwhite and we do not recommend you do this, but you can if you really want to.\r\n\r\nQuoting\r\n-------\r\nThe Beamer TU/e theme comes with a custom quote environment. That is, the \r\ndefault quote environment is styled in a more TU/e-like way. If you do not like \r\nthe new environment, you can use the `\\begin{oldquote}` and `\\end{oldquote}` \r\ncommands to get the old quote environment without additional styling.\r\n\r\nThe complete documentation of the new quote environment is as follows.\r\n\r\n    \\begin{quote}[quote width][top margin]{name of cited person}[extra information about cited person]\r\n        ...\r\n    \\end{quote}\r\n\r\nAll arguments are optional, despite the fact that the name of the cited person \r\nshould be given using `{...}` instead of the usual `[...]`. This is done so that \r\nthe spacing parameters need not be specified to be able to specify the cited \r\nperson and information about them. Default values are as follows:\r\n\r\n| Option key           | Default value\r\n| -------------------- | ---------------\r\n| quote width          | `0.9\\textwidth`\r\n| top margin           | `.4em`\r\n| name of cited person | (empty string)\r\n| extra information    | (empty string)\r\n\r\nAs is shown in the `quote-environment` example in this repository, you can \r\nchange the size of the quotation marks that are set around the quote. This can \r\nbe done by redefining the `\\quotesize` command. The default value is 60, but you \r\ncan change it to 40 by putting `\\renewcommand{\\quotesize}{40}` anywhere before \r\nyour quote.\r\n\r\nTU/e font installation\r\n----------------------\r\nYou may notice that the font is incorrect (and there may be warnings coming from \r\nLaTeX telling you so). In that case, you probably need to install the TU/e font \r\nin such a way that LaTeX can use it. On Linux and Mac, you can do so as follows \r\nbelow. On Windows, refer to [the Windows \r\nsubsection](#font-installation-on-windows-miktex). If you encounter a problem, \r\ndo not hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/Caster/Beamer-TUe/issues). \r\nIn case there is a problem with Beamer-TUe, you are welcome to open a [pull \r\nrequest](https://github.com/Caster/Beamer-TUe/pulls).\r\n\r\n  1. [Download](https://github.com/Caster/Beamer-TUe/blob/master/TUe-fonts/latex_huisstijl.zip?raw=true)\r\nthe `latex_huisstijl.zip` ZIP archive from the `TUe-fonts` folder in the\r\nrepository. You can skip this step if you cloned the repository.\r\n  2. There are now two options. You can install the font system-wide, or only\r\nfor your local user. If you have root access, we recommend the system-wide\r\ninstallation.\r\n    1. *(system-wide)* Find out where your system-wide local `texmf` directory \r\n        is located. You can do so by executing (need not be run as root):\r\n\r\n        <pre>\r\n        <b>$</b> kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL\r\n        </pre>\r\n    \r\n        If this does not give any output, then the value is not set. You can set \r\n        it to any directory you like using the below command. Normally, this \r\n        directory will be `/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local` or \r\n        `/usr/local/share/texmf` for example.\r\n\r\n        <pre>\r\n        <b>$</b> tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFLOCAL /usr/local/share/texmf\r\n        </pre>\r\n\r\n        You can now unzip the archive in this local `texmf` directory, possibly \r\n        creating the directory if it does not exist yet.\r\n\r\n    2. *(single user)* Unzip the archive in a `texmf` directory in your home \r\n        folder, so `~/texmf`. If this `texmf` folder does not exist yet, you can \r\n        create it. The name and location of this folder are important, because \r\n        your LaTeX distribution will look in this directory for fonts and \r\n        packages.\r\n\r\n  3. The next step is to let LaTeX know that you installed a font. Again, there \r\nare two options depending on if your installation is system-wide or not.\r\n    1. *(system-wide)* Open a command line and run the following commands (if you \r\n        do not have `sudo` installed, run them as root, so `su` before you start \r\n        them and without `sudo` per command):\r\n\r\n        <pre>\r\n        <b>$</b> sudo mktexlsr\r\n        <b>$</b> sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=tue.map\r\n        </pre>\r\n\r\n    2. *(single user)* Open a command line and run the following command (not as \r\n        root):\r\n    \r\n        <pre>\r\n        <b>$</b> updmap --enable Map=tue.map\r\n        </pre>\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you should now be able to use the `zmb` font family in LaTeX \r\nand use the TU/e font! Do not forget to `\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}` however.\r\n\r\n####Troubleshooting\r\nMake sure LaTeX can find the TU/e fonts by executing the following command, that \r\nshould output the path to your `texmf` directory followed by `fonts/map/tue.map`. \r\nExample output is provided below.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<b>$</b> kpsewhich tue.map\r\n/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/tue.map\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf this command does not give any output, make sure your `texmf` directory is \r\nknown by LaTeX. Check if it is listed in the output of (again, sample output)\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<b>$</b> tlmgr conf 2>&1 | grep '^TEXMF[LH]'\r\nTEXMFLOCAL=/usr/local/share/texmf\r\nTEXMFHOME=/home/thom/texmf\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf not, use `tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFLOCAL /usr/local/share/texmf`, substituting \r\nthe variable and path to what you need, to set either `TEXMFLOCAL` (for \r\nsystem-wide installations) or `TEXMFHOME` (for single user installations) to the \r\npath to your `texmf` directory.\r\n\r\n###Font installation on Windows (MiKTeX)\r\nInstalling the TU/e font on Windows in such a way that LaTeX can use it is \r\nslightly more elaborate than on Linux and Mac, but it should be easy to follow \r\nthe steps in this section to make it work. The steps are taken from [this answer \r\nat TeX.SE](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/95456/23145), but has been changed so \r\nthat it specifically targets the TU/e font installation, instead of Frutiger.\r\n\r\n####Create a local texmf tree\r\nIf no local texmf tree exists, you can create the folder `C:/localtexmf`. The \r\nsubtrees you need depend on what you want to install into this directory, but in \r\nyour case it should be sufficient to include the following:\r\n\r\n    C:/localtexmf/doc/latex\r\n                 /tex/latex\r\n\r\nThen go to MikTeX's *Settings (Admin)* in the Start Menu, click on the *Roots* \r\ntab and add `C:/localtexmf`. Next click on the *General* tab and click on \r\n*Refresh FNDB*.\r\n\r\nComplete instructions for the creation of a local texmf tree in MiKTeX can be \r\nfound [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/69484/14497). More information on \r\nTDS compliance can be found [here](http://tug.org/tds/tds.html).\r\n\r\n####Install fonts\r\nDownload \r\n[`latex_huisstijl.zip`](https://github.com/Caster/Beamer-TUe/raw/master/TUe-fonts/latex_huisstijl.zip)\r\nfrom this repository and unpack it in your `C:/localtexmf` folder (or copy its \r\ncontents there). This means that for example the file\r\n\r\n    dvips/config/tue.map\r\n\r\nwould go in `C:/localtexmf/dvips/config`, the folder\r\n\r\n    fonts/tfm/tue/huisstyl\r\n\r\nwould go in `C:/localtexmf/fonts/tfm/tue/huisstyl`, et cetera.\r\n\r\nNext, on the Windows command prompt, type\r\n\r\n    initexmf --admin --edit-config-file updmap\r\n\r\nthen add the line\r\n\r\n    Map tue.map\r\n\r\nand save. Afterwards, run\r\n\r\n     initexmf -u\r\n     initexmf --mkmaps\r\n\r\nFinally, refresh the FNDB. Try running `kpsewhich tue.map` on the Windows \r\ncommand prompt. It should return the location of the map file; if it doesn't, \r\nsomehow it is not visible to TeX. Otherwise, you are done and are now able to \r\nuse the `zmb` font family in LaTeX and use the TU/e font! Do not forget to \r\n`\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}` however. All examples in this repository use the \r\n`zmb` font family and hence should look better after you have done all this.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
